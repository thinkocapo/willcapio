**2014** I tried programming in C++ for fun. I enjoyed the feeling of creativty and power to fix things myself. I didn't have to send emails and wait around for responses and ping managers to get things done. I felt less like a middleman and felt like I was fixing things myself. With people you have to wait 24-48 hours for a response to the emails you send them. With code the computer responds right away.
