The story of why and how I started to code, and the places it's taken me.             

**2014** started programming in C++ as a hobby  
**2015** started programming in javascript full-time by leaving my job and moving to Brazil:

Got an internship at Educare.com.br with these guys:

And bit by a dog when I was skateboarding in Argentina:

I'm never afraid to take one for the team:

**2015** I left Brazil to attend Fullstack Academy (NYC) to go from amateur to professional developer. I learned to make super useful things:
