An interesting point is that in order to experience the beneficial effect of the Sanskrit sounds, understanding the meaning is not necessary. This is because in Sanskrit there is a special connection between the sound and the meaning, between the name and the form it represents. In Sanskrit the sound and the meaning are not considered  as two different entities but as one and the same.

In other words, the sounds of Sanskrit carry the qualities of the meaning on the very level of their vibrational frequency. This means that even without understanding the meaning, chanting or listening to Sanskrit verses (or repeating short mantras in meditative procedures, or even reciting the flow of the Sanskrit alphabet) could generate a very beautiful effect on the mind and on the body.

From our experience and experience of others, we can testify that simply listening or reciting Sanskrit hymns, verses, or mantras, has a very profound soothing, healing and revitalizing effect
