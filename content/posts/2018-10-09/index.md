## Why Learn Sanskrit

One awesome reason:
> The most practical value of learning Sanskrit lies in the fact that it trains the mind to think logically, brings clarity of expression, develops intellectual strength, and provides keen insight into the meanings of the words.

A reason for programmers:
> It's object-oriented

The way it exposes/illuminates the vedic/hindu/eastern belief systems and methods of inquiry. appreciate., questions of ranging from metaphysics to epistemology (nature of knowledge) and ontology (nature of being)

## What is Sanskrit
[Overview](http://www.learnsanskrit.org/introduction):
> In the strictest sense of the term, **Sanskrit** refers to a later "preserved" form of the language of the [**Vedas**](https://www.learnreligions.com/what-are-vedas-1769572), a set of ancient compositions among the oldest known in any **Indo-European** language. The older form of the language, variously called either Vedic Sanskrit or just Vedic, was likely the native language of its users. But from the Vedas onward, the language started to lose many of its features. Then, around the 5th century BC, a grammarian known as [**Panini**](https://www.americansanskrit.com/panini) (pronounced "paa-ni-nee" in English) essentially "froze" the language, transforming it from the fluid native language of the ancient Indians to an unchanging and timeless language for **intellectual expression**, both in India and in the whole of South and Southeast Asia. Near this time, the last native speakers of Sanskrit had probably already died.  

The [Astadhyayi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#A%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%AD%C4%81dhy%C4%81y%C4%AB) is Panini's work on Sanskrit grammar.

## Vedic Belief Systems / Religion
The [Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads) were the last written part of the Vedas and the basis for [Advaita Vedanta](https://realization.org/p/topics/advaita-vedanta/advaita-vedanta.html).

## Vedic and Eastern Philosophies from East to West
[Sri Ramakrishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramakrishna) taught [Swami Vivekananda](https://vedantasociety.net/vivekananda) who represented Hindu at [Chicago's Parliament of Religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_World%27s_Religions) in 1893.

Mark Twain
> "*India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grandmother of tradition. Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only.*"
  
Ralph Waldo Emerson
> "*Whenever I have read any part of the Vedas, I have felt that some unearthly and unknown light illuminated me...When I read it, I feel that I am under the spangled heavens of a summer night*"

Sir William Jones
> "*The Sanscrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists*"

Therapeutic Effects of Sanskrit Mantras...  
[The Healing Sounds of Sanskrit](http://enjoylearningsanskrit.com/the-healing-sounds-of-sanskrit)  
> An interesting point is that in order to experience the beneficial effect of the Sanskrit sounds, understanding the meaning is not necessary. This is because in Sanskrit there is a **special connection between the sound and the meaning**, between the name and the form it represents. In Sanskrit the sound and the meaning are not considered  as two different entities but as one and the same.

> In other words, the sounds of Sanskrit carry the qualities of the meaning on the very level of their **vibrational frequency**. This means that even without understanding the meaning, chanting or listening to Sanskrit verses (or repeating short mantras in meditative procedures, or even reciting the flow of the Sanskrit alphabet) could generate a very beautiful effect on the mind and on the body.

> From our experience and experience of others, we can testify that simply **listening or reciting Sanskrit hymns, verses, or mantras, has a very profound soothing, healing and revitalizing effect**

## Yoga / Meditation / Health

[The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali - Defined](https://iep.utm.edu/yoga/)  he's the father of yoga
> **In contrast to its modern Western transplanted forms**, Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object. 
sutras vs mantras

[The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali](https://chopra.com/articles/yoga-sutras-101-everything-you-need-to-know)
> “Yoga is the progressive settling of the mind into silence."  
> "When the mind is settled, we are established in our own essential state, which is unbounded consciousness."  
> "Our essential nature is usually overshadowed by the activity of the mind”

> Raja  Yoga itself is an integral approach. It does not simply advocate meditation, but takes into consideration the entire life of a person. Its philosophy is scientific. It welcomes and in fact demands experimental verification by the student...Its goal is nothing less than the total transformation of a seemingly limited physical, mental and emotional person into a fully illumined, thoroughly harmonized and perfected being- from an individual with likes and dislikes, pains and pleasures, successues and failtures, to a sage of permanent peace, joy and selfless dedication to the entire creation...

> For thousands of years the Yogis have probed the mysteries of the mind and consciousness and we may well discover that some of their findings are applicable to our own search as well.

> it may be interesting and useful to know how to fix a car or cook a meal or how atoms are split. But something that holds a more immediate and vital interest for thoughtful people is their own mind. What is the mind?...
